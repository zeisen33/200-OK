# README

200 OK is a forum for asking and answering coding questions. Anyone can search for and view user submitted questions and their answers.

Creating a 200 OK account is free. Once you've created an account, you can ask questions, answer questions, and upvote or downvote answers to show others if the answer was helpful.

For each question, higher voted answers are shown first. 

Once submitted, questions, answers, and votes can all be changed or deleted.

Currently, user authentication, questions, and answers are working. Voting and searching are in progress.

200 OK was built using Ruby on Rails, React, and Redux, with postgresql for the database.
